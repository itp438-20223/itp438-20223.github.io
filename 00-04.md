# Committing to Perforce

Now you're going to commit your files to Perforce, which will take about 1 hour (almost all of the time is waiting for an operation to finish). For this, you're going to use the [tutorial](https://allarsblog.com/2017/04/05/populating-perforce-with-an-unreal-engine-source-build/) again:

- You just need to do the "Testing the Ignore File" and then "Submitting Engine files" steps
- It will take approximately 15 minutes for the Mark for Add step to finish
- The number of files in your change list should be around 207,386. If you have *a lot* more files than that it probably means your `.p4ignore` file is not correct
- It will take about 45 minutes for the Submit step to finish

Once the submit is finished, you're done with the required setup! If you'd like to also setup your local machine for development, you can continue on to [(Optional) Setting Up a Local Machine](00-05.html). Otherwise, you're done with your setup and should shut down your VM!

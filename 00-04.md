# Committing to Perforce

Now you're going to commit your files to Perforce, which will take about 1 hour (almost all of the time is waiting for an operation to finish). For this, you're going to use the [tutorial](https://allarsblog.com/2017/04/05/populating-perforce-with-an-unreal-engine-source-build/) again:

First, do the "Testing the Ignore File" step in the tutorial to confirm that your `.p4ignore` file works properly.

It is critical that you confirm that your `.p4ignore` is setup properly and Perforce knows about it. Also, make sure the file name is just `.p4ignore` and not `.p4ignore.txt` or something like that. Make sure you do the “Testing The Ignore File” step in the tutorial and confirm that it’s not going to try to check in ignored folders as if you don’t set it up properly, you’ll likely have to set up your server again!

Now follow the "Submitting Engine files" steps. Some notes:

- It will take approximately 15 minutes for the "Mark for Add" step to finish
- When the "Mark for Add" step finishes, click the down arrow for the default changelist and it should say that there's approximately 231,643 files in the changelist. If you have *a lot* more files than that it probably means your `.p4ignore` file is not correct and **you need to fix that first**
- It will take about 45 minutes for the Submit step to finish

Once the submit is finished, you're done with the required setup! If you'd like to also setup your local machine for development, you can continue on to [(Optional) Setting Up a Local Machine](00-05.html). Otherwise, you're done with your setup and should shut down your VM!

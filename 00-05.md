# (Optional) Setting Up a Local Machine

Keep in mind that Unreal 5 requires a fairly powerful machine for development. As mentioned before, the minimum specs are roughly:

- Windows 10 (although the editor does run on Mac and Linux as well, I don't recommend it)
- 8-core CPU
- 32 GB of system RAM
- Nvidia GTX 1080 or AMD RX Vega 64 w/ 8GB of VRAM
- 250+ GB free space on an SSD

If your machine doesn't meet these specs, it probably is not worth setting up your local machine, and instead you should just stick to using your VM, which you've already setup!

## Requesting a Public IP

To be able to connect to your VM's Perforce server remotely, you need a Public IP address which will make the machine accessible on the Internet. If you'd like a Public IP, please post on the corresponding Piazza thread to request one and I'll add one to your VM.

Once you have a Public IP, on the Paperspace console (which shows your machine), go to the settings for your VM and it will say what your Public IP address is. Keep that number handy.

## Local: Install Visual Studio 2022

You need to install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (community edition is fine). You need to install the following workflows:

- Desktop Development with C++
- Game Development with C++
- .NET desktop development
- Universal Windows Platform development

If you've previously installed Visual Studio 2022, you can go into the installer and "Modify" to add any workflows you're missing.

{: .info }
You may wonder why you need .NET/C# workflows. The reason is a decent amount of the support tooling for Unreal is written in C#, and so you typically need these workflows for everything to build properly.

## Local: Install P4V

You also need to install [P4V](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-visual-client-p4v) locally. You can leave everything on the default settings.

## VM: Configuring Firewall Rules

Start up your Paperspace VM, and:

1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to "Firewall & network protection"
3. Select "Advanced settings"
4. In the Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security window, select "Inbound Rules" on the left column and "New Rule..." on the right:
   ![Firewall rules](images/00/firewall.png)
5. For Rule Type, select "Port" and click Next
6. For Protocol and Ports, under "Specific Local Port" type 1666 and click Next
7. Click Next past Action and Profile
8. For Name, just name it "Perforce Server"

## Local: Syncing to Perforce

Your VM also needs to be running for the duration of this step. Keep in mind this initial sync will need to download a lot of data, which means how long it'll take will depend on your connection to some degree (although outbound connections from the VM are limited to 100Mbps, so you can't go faster than that). On my connection it took about 25 minutes for the sync to finish. If you're not on a stable connection right now, I'd suggest shutting down your VM for now and resuming this step later.

1. Run P4V locally
2. On the "Open Connection" dialog, for Server put `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:1666`, where the `X`s are your public IP address. For User put the username you created on your Perforce server. And then click the "New" button for the Workspace:
   ![Perforce Open Connection dialog](images/00/p4-connect.png)
3. I'll ask for your password which is the one you setup earlier on the server
4. For the workspace root, use wherever you'd like (but a short path is best)
5. On the "Advanced" tab, enable Modtime, Rmdir, and On submit "Revert unchanged files" like before
6. Then click OK to create the new workspace
7. In the workspace view, right click on your root directory and say "Get Latest Revision":
   ![Perforce - Get Latest Revision](images/00/p4-revision.png)
8. Assuming you have a solid connection, the sync will finish after about 25 minutes. Confirm that the files are on your local machine in your Workspace directory
9. Now you need to tell Perforce to use your `.p4ignore` (as it's enforced per workspace)
10. Open a command prompt and navigate to your workspace root
11. Run: `p4 set P4IGNORE=.p4ignore`
12. Now close P4V
13. At this point, ***shut down*** your VM, as you will be working disconnected from the Perforce server.

{: .warn }
You should only turn on the VM when you need to immediately use the Perforce server -- either because you want to sync or because you want to commit files. After you finish the operation, you should always shut down your Perforce server immediately. This is to make sure you don't accidentally leave your VM running forever which will cost too much money. In the real world (TM), your Perforce server would always be on, but we have a limited budget so we aren't doing that.

## Local: Building Unreal + TopDown

Again -- at this point your VM should be shut down. If it's not shut down yet, shut it down now! Unfortunately, you now have to build Unreal again locally. But as with the VM, once you finish this one big build, you shouldn't have to do another build that takes this long for the rest of the semester.

1. Go to your `UnrealEngine` directory in your Workspace
2. Run `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` which will make your Visual Studio solution. If this gives an error you may have to run `Setup.bat` first (you can ignore any warning it gives you), and then try `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` again.
4. Open up the UE5.sln. Right click on the TopDown project, set it as the startup project, then right click and build
5. How long the build will take will mostly depend on the number of CPU cores as well as the amount of RAM you have. For example, my 12-core (24-thread) machine takes about 45 minutes

## Local: Running TopDown

As we're working offline from Perforce, one of the issues you'll run into is that many files will be marked as read-only and you will not be able to "check out" the files from Peforce to make them writable. In general, what you'll do is mark the files as writable locally, then when you're ready to check in you can turn back on the server and reconcile your offline work just on the TopDown directory, which won't take too long.

Now let's run TopDown locally.

1. Click the Play button in Visual Studio to start the editor. You'll have to wait for the shaders to compile.
2. Once the shaders finish compiling, save the map
3. Unreal will warn you that the file is read-only, but it gives you the option to make the file writable, so do that:
   ![Make writable in Unreal](images/00/writable.png)
4. You may get an editor error saying that it wasn't able to save TopDownExampleMap_BuiltData (because it wasn't writable). This seems to be a bug that it doesn't ask you to make the map built data writable (as Unreal 4 does usually).
5. To fix this, open the content drawer, browse to Content>TopDownCPP>Maps and right click on the BuiltData and save it, which will let you make it writable as well and save
6. Now close the editor, as you won't be doing anything else with it for now

## Local + VM: Reconciling Offline Work

The last step is to commit any changes you've made to Perforce. To do this:

1. Start up your VM
2. Open P4V on your local machine and connect to the server
3. We know we've changed files in the Content directory that we want to update on the server. Right click on the TopDown/Content directory in your Workspace view and select "Reconcile offline work...":
   ![Reconcile](images/00/reconcile.png)
4. The reconcile should finish almost immediately, and in your case should find that two files been modified -- the map and the built data for the map. Always review this list of files to make sure it makes sense that they're all files you want to change
5. In general your best bet will be to always reconcile Config, Content, and Source every time you are ready to commit, as that will be almost everything that could change in your commits
6. One exception to (5) is that the TopDown.uproject might change, but you can't reconcile a single file. Instead, if the file icon is shaded in blue, that means it's changed locally, and in this case you right click on the file and say "Check Out...".
7. Importantly, you don't want to reconcile the entire TopDown directory, as that will also reconcile TopDown/Binaries which, if you end up using both the VM and your local machine you'll end up just overwriting the Binaries over and over, which is unnecessary.
8. Submit the changelist with your two modified files (much like how you submitted other files during the tutorial)
9. Once the submit finishes, close your P4V
10. Shutdown the VM

In this way you'll only be turning on the VM for small windows of times, which will keep costs down and prevent you from accidentally keeping it running for long stretches of time when you don't need it.

{: .info }
On a real game project you would ultimately want some machine to check in update binaries (for example, a separate machine that does builds). However, to prevent conflicts between those binaries and the ones the programmers want to build locally, you can create *Streams* which allow for example programmers to not sync to source assets or binary files, which they don't need. And similarly you could setup a stream for the artists that excludes all of the source code which they don't need. However, this is a bit more advanced to setup in Perforce and since you're the only developer (just on multiple machines), we won't go into how to use them.

## Developing Both Locally and on the VM

If you plan on using both the VM and a local machine, you'll want to always commit your changes when you're done on one machine so that you can always sync to the latest version on either machine. It's also good to get the habit of running `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` after you sync, as that'll make sure any new source files get added to Visual Studio (although the code will still compile even if you don't do this).

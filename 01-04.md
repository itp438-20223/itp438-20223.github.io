# Submission Requirements

As mentioned in lecture, we will not be syncing to everyone's Perforce. Instead, you will need to submit a video as well as some supporting files to the Google Drive that's shared with you.

For this assignment, put your files in the `01` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. Your video - It should demonstrate that you can move around the character with click-to-move and that the watermark properly shows on screen
2. DefaultGame.ini
3. DefaultEngine.ini
4. TopDownHUD.h
5. TopDownHUD.cpp
6. TopDown.uproject
7. A screenshot of the Perforce diff for your change to LC_Coff.cpp. Consult this week's video on Perforce if you don't remember how to view the Perforce diff.

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. DefaultGame.ini and DefaultEngine.ini are configured as per the assignment instructions (these automatically will get modified if you made the required changes)
2. SubtitleFont was created as per the instructions
3. Implemented the TopDownHUD class which overrides DrawHUD to draw your watermark
4. Applied the patch to LC_Coff.cpp and built a new LiveCodingClient.exe

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/CodingStandard/).

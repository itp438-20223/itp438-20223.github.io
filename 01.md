# Assignment 1 - Unreal Basics

**Due Date: 8/30 @ 11:59PM**

You can't begin this assignment until you've completed the [Setup](https://itp499-20213.github.io/00.html). Because it will take several hours to complete the setup, this first assignment intentionally does not have too much coding. That being said, you will learn fundamental skills that will be critical for the rest of the semester.

In this assignment, you will:

1. Configure your Unreal project by setting some recommended options
2. Add a basic HUD class that we'll use to draw a "watermark" on your screen
4. Learn how to use live coding to iterate on your code quickly

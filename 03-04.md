# Submission Requirements

For this assignment, put your files in the `03` folder on your Google Drive. You need to submit the following:

1. Your video - Primarily, we want to see that your Morse code puzzle works with the world "OPEN". As in the sample video, demonstrate both the playback and the resetting behavior when you do the wrong sequence. You should also just briefly demonstrate that your interact selection/highlight works. Also show that you can toggle/on the debug visualization with our new console command.
2. PuzzleMorse.h
3. PuzzleMorse.cpp
4. InteractSubsystem.h
5. InteractSubsystem.cpp
6. InteractComponent.h
7. InteractComponent.cpp
8. TopDownHUD.cpp
9. PuzzleComponent.cpp

## Grading Specification

To receive a grade of B, you must have the following:

1. The interact system improvements (glow, hint, improved best candidate, and toggle) are implemented
2. Basic Morse puzzle code setup is completed to spec
3. The Morse puzzle playback mode correctly plays back the sequence
4. The Morse puzzle solving works properly
5. The Morse puzzle output lights all light up at the correct points
6. Improved debug visualization and console command is implemented

To get an A, you must satisfy the above as well as write quality code. Keep in mind that we will be looking for adherence to the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/CodingStandard/).

# Ammo Pickups

For this part, there are no detailed instructions. Instead, you will have to implement the features based on the described gameplay and videos.

## Tracking Ammo

Right now, you can fire infinitely however much you want to. Change it so every ***character*** starts with 5 ammo, and every time the player fires they lose an ammo. Once they have 0 ammo left, they shouldn't be able to shoot anymore (and it shouldn't play the animation or sound, either). Add text to the HUD which shows how much ammo the player has left.

*Hint*: Keep in mind that the server should be authority on how much ammo the player has left, and the client should simply just show this value (replicated).

*Hint 2*: Since the server is authority, it should validate that the player has ammo left before firing.

If this works properly, it'll look something like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/08-03-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Picking Up More Ammo

Add a new C++ actor subclass called `AmmoPickup`:

- It should replicate
- Its root component should be a `USphereComponent` with a sphere radius of 25.0f
- It should also have a `UTextRenderComponent` attached to the root that says "Ammo," has a vertical/horizonal alignment of center, and has a green render color
- It should have a `UPROPERTY` that designers can edit to set the amount of ammo it gives (defaults to 5)
- When a character overlaps with the pickup, it should give them the amount of ammo specified by the variable
- You should also make a blueprint of it so it can be configured by designers

*Hint*: Remember you only want the overlapping to do something on the server.

Manually place several instances of the pickup blueprint in the level and test it out! If it works, it should look like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/08-03-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Now it's time to [submit](08-04.html).

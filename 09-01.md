# Alerts and End of Match

In this part, we'll first add a method for the server to send text alerts to all clients, and then add some logic to handle the end of the match.

## Alert

We want to add a method for the server to send text alerts to all the clients. This will show text centered in their HUD widget in a specified color and for a specified duration. For testing it, we'll add a `"STARTING MATCH"` alert that the server sends to all clients to display for 3 seconds once the match starts, which will look like this:

Since the GameMode isn't replicated to clients, the easiest way to send something to all clients is via a reliable multicast function in the GameState. Then you can set it up so that function ultimately tells the HUDWidget what to show.

You'll want your multicast to be reliable and take in three parameters:

- A const `FString&` for the text to show
- An `FLinearColor` for the color
- A `float` for the duration

Then, add the `"STARTING MATCH"` message in green that displays for 3 seconds.

*Hints*:

- Since the Multicast function is called on each client, you can add functions to both the both the player controller and the HUDWidget to handle the alert on the client. So, the multicast function would call a on the player controller (if `IsLocalController()` is true), which in turn can call a function on the `HUDWidgetInstance` 
- On each client, `UGameplayStatics::GetPlayerController` index 0 returns the local player controller (since the non-local player controllers are not created on clients) so you don't have to worry about changing the index based on the client
- You can use a gameplay timer to hide the alert text after the time is up
- Make sure the text element starts out as "Hidden" (you can just configure this in the UMG editor, you don't need to do it in code). Note that it will still show Hidden elements in the UMG editor.
- You will need to add `"SlateCore"` as an additional dependency to `Multi.uproject` or you won't be able to set the color on the text element
- You can send the alert from the same place you call `StartMatch` in your game state `Tick` function

Before moving on, verify that you see "STARTING MATCH" in green on each client when the game starts, and the text disappears after three seconds.

## End of Match

The default GameMode implementation of `ReadyToEndMatch_Implementation` is that it always returns `false`, so the match never ends. Override it so that the match ends when either team reaches 10 points.

When the match ends (override `HandleMatchHasEnded` in GameMode):

- You should display an alert that says either `"RED TEAM WINS"` or `"BLUE TEAM WINS"` in either red or blue for 5 seconds (obviously, show the correct winner)
- When the match isn't in progress, players shouldn't be able to score any points
- After 5 seconds, you should also call `RestartGame` on the game mode, which will reload the level -- to test this requires launching with "Standalone Game" selected in the editor PIE dropdown (see warning below)
- You'll also need to fix it so the timer text so it only is visible if the match state is specifically in `WaitingToStart`. Keep in mind the `MatchState` values are defined in `"GameFramework/GameMode.h"`

{: .warn }
`RestartGame` relies on "server travel" to work properly. Unfortunately, server travel does not work correctly in the PIE testing mode. It will just end up permanently disconnecting all PIE clients. So to confirm and show that this behavior works, you will need to run in "Standalone Game." Keep in mind that Live Coding does ***NOT*** affect standalone instances, so if you make any live coding changes, you either have to test with PIE or restart the editor.

If this works properly, it will look like this:

Now it's time to add player respawning In [part 2](09-02.html).

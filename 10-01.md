# Improvements

In this part, you're going to improve several smaller things with the game.

## Fixing 3rd Person Jump

We're going to fix the 3rd person jump by using the three jump animations we had in TopDown.

First, in Visual Studio, right click on the TopDown project and change it back to your startup project. Then launch it and in the Content Drawer, go to Characters>Mannequins>Animations>Manny. Select these three animations:

- MM_Fall_Loop
- MM_Jump
- MM_Land

Then right click and say Retarget Anim Assets>Duplicate Anim Assets and Retarget:

* For the IK Retargeter, select RG_UE5Manny_UE4Manny (as this retargets the animations to the older mannequin)
* Set the folder to /Game/AnimStarterPack

Now in the content drawer, select those three MM animations and save them. Then right click and say Asset Actions>Migrate. When the dialog comes up saying which assets you're going to migrate, uncheck toe UE4_Mannequin and Characters folders, so it will only migrate the three animations. Then, select the Multi/Content folder as the destination.

Then, close TopDown switch back to Multi as your startup project and launch it. If you then go under the AnimStarterPack folder in Multi, you should see the three ThirdPersonJump animations you migrated.

Try to open one and you'll get an error about a missing skeleton and whether you want to choose a new one. Say "Yes" and select UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton. It'll open and should look correct, and then save the animation. You'll need to repeat this for all three MM animations you migrated.

For MM_Land specifically, you also need to go into the "Asset Details" and change the "Additive AnimType" to "No additive". Otherwise, it won't work properly.

Now, change the UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint so that the jump uses the three animations that transition correctly based on whether you're jumping or not. To do this:

* In the anim graph, instead of the Jump and Run Jump States, you need to add 3 different states: Start Jump, Jump Loop, End Jump (sort of like what you did for prone)
* Delete the existing "Jump" nodes in the event graph as you don't need them anymore
* Get rid of the "Enable Jump" and "Is Jumping" variable
* Add a new "Is Falling" variable that is updated in Event Blueprint Update Animation from whether the character is falling or not
* Hook up the transitions for the 3 jump states you added (remember you can use "Time Remaining (ratio) ")

Keep in mind that because UE4ASP_HeroTPP has a different state for Idle and Run, which both can lead to jump states, you will need to add transitions and the intermediate start/end states to both.

Once this is setup, you should be able to see the third person model use the jumping animation, like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/10-01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


{: .note }
Notice how in the jumping animation, the player's arms go to the side so the gun goes there as well. If we wanted to keep the upper body animations the same but only change the lower body animations, it would be possible However, this requires more work. You can look at "[Using Layered Animations](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/using-layered-animations-in-unreal-engine/)" in the documentation for further information.

## 3rd Person Death Camera

Rather than showing your death in first-person, we'll change it to use a 3rd person camera instead when you die.

First, in MultiCharacter you'll need to add an additional `UCameraComponent` called `ThirdPersonCameraComponent`. When you create it in the constructor:

- Attach it to Mesh3P
- Set `bUsePawnControlRotation` to `false`
- Set `bAutoActive` to `false`
- Set the relative location to `(0.f, -400.f, 350.f)`
- Set the relative rotation to `(-45.f, 90.f, 0.f)`

Then when you are about to play the death animation on a client, you should check if the player is locally controlled, in which case you need to:

- Make it so the owner can't see the first-person mesh and gun (for the gun, you'll have to get the `USkeletalMeshComponent` from the `WeaponActor`)
- Make it so the owner can see the third-person mesh and gun
- Deactivate the first person camera component
- Activate your 3rd-person camera component

Keep in mind this is only changing everything for the local client, but that's fine. The server doesn't need to be involved to handle this.

If this works properly, it should look like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/10-01-2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Death Respawn Timer

Finally, we want to make it so when you die, the local client shows both a message that you're dead as well as a 5 second countdown timer. For this timer, you can completely manage it locally -- the server doesn't have to be involved.

{: .warn }
Handling the respawn timer on the client separately like this only works since the respawn timer is a fixed amount of time. We know it's always 5 seconds so we can just fake showing the timer on the client completely independent of the server. However, if the timer could vary -- for example every time you die, the timer gets longer, the server would have to tell us what the correct timer is.

Confirm that when you die now, you see a death message as well as a timer, like this:

<video style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="assets/10-01-3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Now it's time to add text chat in [part 2](10-02.html).

# Schedule

This page contains the schedule for the entire semester including lecture notes, flipped classroom videos, and assignments. It's designed to help keep track of when everything's due.

## Note on Remote Attendance

This course does not support remote attendance. Lectures will not be recorded or available on Zoom, and students will need to attend the flipped classroom meetings to get credit for them.

## Lectures

Lectures will be on Mondays during the semester, as outlined in the table above. Lecture notes will become available on this site no later than the day of the lecture.

## Programming Assignments

There are a total of 12 assignments this semester. The table above will be updated as the semester progresses.

Assignment submissions will require uploading a video demonstrating features as well as supplemental files as indicated in each assignment's instructions.

Students are expected to follow the [Unreal Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/epic-cplusplus-coding-standardblueprint-debugging-in-unreal-engine/) for all code written in this class.

Except for the final assignment, assignments will be due on Tuesday nights at 11:59PM. The assignment instructions for the following week will also become available at that time.

## Flipped Classrooms

There are a total of 12 flipped classroom meetings on Wednesdays during the semester listed in the table above.

Prior to each flipped classroom meeting, you are expected to watch that week's videos ***before*** class. You can expect 30-45 minutes of videos each week. Video links will be available on this site no later than Monday of the corresponding week.

During the class meeting, you will work on the programming assignment for that week.

At the conclusion of each of these meetings, you'll be asked to submit a short assignment on Gradescope that will both quiz you on the material covered in the videos and ask you to describe the progress made on your assignment during class. The Gradescope assignment will be graded Credit (CR)/No Credit (NC).

## **Exams**

There is a midterm and final exam, which are both take-home coding exams. Note that both exams do require that you're mostly caught up on the assignments that have been due to that point.
